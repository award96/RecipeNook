                Anders lives in Mountain View, California where he spends his
                days coding, hiking, and of course enjoying the unique culinary
                blend that the Bay Area has to offer. He is a graduate of the UC
                Santa Cruz department of Physics, where he completed research
                for the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics. Having
                studied abroad in France, he loves travel and language, a
                necessary compliment to his current work in web development.
